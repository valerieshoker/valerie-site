    <h1>🪞 About Me</h1>

    <p>Hi, I’m Valerie — future lawyer (currently applying), writer, researcher, and occasional late-night coder. I care deeply about health equity, public policy, and social justice rooted in community.</p>

    <p>I graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.A. in Political Economy in May of 2024. I’ve worked in public health, research, and education — and recently began exploring code as a way to share my research more equitably.</p>

    <p>I’m currently based in the Bay Area, spending most of my days reading something new, drinking pour-over, and working on solo projects often inspired by the books that changed me. This site is part portfolio, part journal, and part cozy digital room I built in my head.</p>
